## Brief information about me
**My goal** is to become a front-end developer. I work as a QA-engineer in an IT company, but I want to develop. Sometimes I develop autotests on the UI, and when they work, I have fun. I think that 36 years is a good time to learn new things and get a good experience.
## Skills
* Python *(for UI autotests and algorithmic tasks)*
* HTML&CSS&JS *(I do small projects, but I want to do big ones)*
* Java and C++ *(a little for fun)*
## Code examples
[My github](https://github.com/mantuokTurnskin)
## Education
University degree
## English language
A1-A2 *(need more listening and speaking skills)*
